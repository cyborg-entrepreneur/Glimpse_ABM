# Table 1: Agent Cognitive Traits and Behavioral Characteristics

| Trait | Definition | Key Behavioral Linkages in ABM | Empirical Foundation | Distribution [Parameters] |
|-------|------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| **Uncertainty Tolerance** | Willingness to act under ambiguous conditions where probability distributions cannot be reliably estimated | (1) Scales minimum acceptable return threshold for investments; (2) Drives AI tool adoption (lower tolerance → higher AI reliance); (3) Modifies opportunity scoring for high-ambiguity ventures; (4) Determines cash reserves held against uncertainty | Budner (1962); McMullen & Shepherd (2006); Hmieleski & Baron (2009); Townsend et al. (2024) | Beta [α=1.05, β=0.65]; Mean=0.62; Right-skewed reflecting self-selection into entrepreneurship and documented optimism bias |
| **Innovativeness** | Propensity to pursue novel solutions and generate creative combinations of existing knowledge | (1) Scales probability of innovation attempts; (2) Influences preference for radical vs. incremental innovation; (3) Modulates breadth of opportunity search; (4) Sets baseline drive for new venture creation | Schumpeter (1934); Kirzner (1973); Lumpkin & Dess (1996); Marcati et al. (2008) | Lognormal [μ=0.5, σ=0.5]; Median=0.50; Log-normal captures power-law distribution of innovation output |
| **Competence** | Accumulated operational capability reflecting domain expertise and execution ability | (1) Reduces monthly operating costs (0.8×-1.0× multiplier); (2) Lowers internal hurdle rate for investments; (3) Evolves through experience—success increases, failure decreases; (4) Affects accuracy of opportunity evaluation | Penrose (1959); Becker (1964); Man et al. (2002); Unger et al. (2011) | Uniform [0.1, 0.8]; Mean=0.45; Wide range captures heterogeneity; upper bound reserves headroom for learning |
| **AI Trust** | Confidence in and willingness to rely on AI-generated recommendations and analyses | (1) Influences AI tier adoption decisions; (2) Scales weight given to AI recommendations vs. independent judgment; (3) Updates based on AI prediction accuracy (Bayesian learning); (4) Affects herding behavior through AI conformity | Davis (1989); Dietvorst et al. (2015); Bansal et al. (2019); Lebovitz et al. (2022) | Normal (clipped) [μ=0.5, σ=0.38]; Mean=0.50; Captures full spectrum from AI skeptics to enthusiasts |
| **Exploration Tendency** | Preference for search and discovery vs. exploitation of known opportunities | (1) Scales opportunity search intensity; (2) Affects portfolio diversification vs. concentration; (3) Influences willingness to experiment with different AI tools; (4) Drives preference for disruptive vs. incremental innovation | March (1991); Levinthal & March (1993); Shane & Venkataraman (2000); Gupta et al. (2006) | Beta [α=0.85, β=0.85]; Mean=0.50; U-shaped distribution reflects empirical polarization toward strategic purity |
| **Entrepreneurial Drive** | Intrinsic motivation for venture creation and persistence through adversity | (1) Increases resistance to exit under financial pressure; (2) Scales survival threshold flexibility; (3) Ensures baseline motivational commitment across all agents | McClelland (1961); Baum & Locke (2004); Cardon et al. (2009); Shane et al. (2003) | Beta [α=2.2, β=1.8]; Mean=0.55; Right-skewed reflecting self-selection of motivated individuals into entrepreneurship |
| **Trait Momentum** | Persistence of behavioral patterns over time; resistance to change from experience | (1) Modulates learning rate for competence and trust updates; (2) Higher momentum → slower adaptation but greater consistency; (3) Influences continuity of innovation strategy over time | Epstein (1979); Teece et al. (1997); Grégoire et al. (2011) | Uniform [0.6, 0.9]; Mean=0.75; Bounded above 0.5 to ensure meaningful behavioral consistency |
| **Cognitive Style** | Characteristic approach to information processing (systematic vs. intuitive) | (1) Multiplies learning rate from experience; (2) Values >1.0 indicate faster/more responsive adaptation; (3) Affects weighting of quantitative vs. pattern-based signals | Kahneman (2011); Allinson & Hayes (1996); Klein (1998); Sadler-Smith (2004) | Uniform [0.8, 1.2]; Mean=1.00; Narrow range centered at neutral; allows moderate influence without dominating |
| **Analytical Ability** | Capacity for systematic evaluation, logical reasoning, and quantitative analysis | (1) Scales precision of return estimates; (2) Reduces penalty from opportunity complexity; (3) Higher ability reduces herding behavior and social proof sensitivity; (4) Improves accuracy of outcome attribution | Jensen (1998); Baron (1998); Simon (1955); Hartog et al. (2010) | Uniform [0.1, 0.9]; Mean=0.50; Wide range reflects high heterogeneity; no systematic selection on this dimension |
| **Market Awareness** | Sensitivity to competitive signals, market trends, and environmental changes | (1) Contributes to probability of opportunity discovery; (2) Affects response speed to competitor entry signals; (3) Influences adaptation rate to market regime transitions | Hambrick (1982); Prescott (1995); Kirzner (1979); Tang et al. (2012) | Uniform [0.1, 0.9]; Mean=0.50; Wide range captures documented heterogeneity in environmental scanning |

## Notes for Table 1

**Distribution Rationale Summary**:
- *Beta distributions* are used for traits with theoretical priors about skewness (uncertainty tolerance, entrepreneurial drive) or polarization (exploration tendency)
- *Lognormal* captures the power-law nature of innovation output
- *Normal (clipped)* for AI trust reflects approximately symmetric variation around moderate baseline
- *Uniform distributions* are used where empirical evidence suggests high heterogeneity without strong distributional priors

**Parameter Validation**:
All distributions are calibrated to produce means and variances consistent with reported effect sizes in the entrepreneurship literature. Beta parameters are selected to match documented self-selection effects and behavioral skewness among entrepreneur populations.

**Behavioral Linkage Notation**:
Linkages reference specific functions in the ABM codebase (agents.py, innovation.py) where each trait directly influences decision-making algorithms.
