"""
Action-dict field name constants.

The agent action / outcome dicts (`Dict{String,Any}`) flow from agent code
(producer) to simulation/market code (consumer). When a producer writes
`outcome["amount"]` and a consumer reads `get(action, "investment_amount", 0)`,
the dataflow silently zeroes — the bug is invisible to a code reader because
both names are plausible. v2.3 had three of these (amount/investment_amount,
estimated/expected_return, cost/explore_cost), each silently disabling a
downstream mechanism.

This module centralizes the names that have bitten us so future producer/
consumer pairs use the same constant. The accompanying
`test/test_action_keys.jl` further enforces consistency by scanning the source
for every consumer key and asserting at least one producer writes it.

Not every action-dict key lives here yet — only the ones we want enforced.
Adding new keys is cheap; renaming existing ones requires updating producers
+ consumers + the constant in one PR.
