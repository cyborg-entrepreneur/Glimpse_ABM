# v3.3.1 regression: demand adjustment clamp.
#
# Pre-v3.3.1 get_demand_adjustments could produce return_penalty=15.67 and
# failure_pressure=-9.36 under crowded sectors due to unchecked multiplicative
# compounding of crowd_excess, crowd_relief, and clearing_ratio terms. The
# negative failure then got clamp-saved to 0.05 at models.jl:224, making
# oversubscribed sectors functionally immortal — an obvious physics violation.
#
# This test installs a crowded-sector state into the market, calls
# get_demand_adjustments directly, and asserts both outputs fall in a sane
# positive range.
