# Producer/consumer consistency check for action-dict keys.
#
# v2.3 review caught three "silent zero" bugs where a consumer read key X but
# producers emitted key Y (e.g. "investment_amount" vs "amount"). Both names
# look reasonable in isolation; the bug is invisible to a code reader.
#
# This test scans the source for every consumer key (`get(<dict>, "X", ...)`
# and `<dict>["X"]` reads) and asserts that at least one producer somewhere
# in the codebase writes that key. Catches typos automatically.
