# Regression test: AI-tier-aware ranking
#
# Asserts that two agents facing the same opportunity set but with different
# AI tiers produce different top-3 rankings in a non-trivial fraction of trials.
#
# Before the 2026-04-23 correctness fixes, this test FAILED — the
# evaluate_portfolio_opportunities function discarded tier-noisy
# `estimated_returns` and ranked by `latent_return_potential` (hidden ground
# truth) for every tier, so all tiers always picked the same top opportunity.
#
# After the fix, `evaluate_opportunity_basic` accepts an `estimated_return`
# parameter that reflects AI tier (via InformationSystem.get_information when
# available, else inline tier-noise model). This test guards against the
# bypass coming back.
